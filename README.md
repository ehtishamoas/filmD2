## Faces Behind D2

### Project Description:
    Students go to D2 every day and usually do not notice how much work is being done to make the system of dining hall thrive. 
All the assignments and deadlines make students rush and forget to even look at the atmosphere of D2: some friends are sharing funny stories from their day, 
while others are reassuring friend who failed their exam and workers are joking with students and among each other too. And often we as students just don’t even try to stop, 
look around and enjoy the moment. That is why, our group’s goal was to tell the story of D2, which is well-known to everyone, yet most of the things about it fall behind 
the scenes.

### Process:
    The first challenge we faced during the process of filming was to get permission to film in a D2, through communicating with external manager. 
Then, we had to find actors for the film, staff and students who had to agree to speak and participate in the video, which was another challenge. 
During the film production, we placed the camera inside D2 and made a time-lapse, and then grabbed the camera around the dining hall to film some live moments during rush hours, 
like chefs cooking food etc. For the interview part, we used clap method to be able to synchronize video and audio, and tried filming from different angles too. The video and
audio qualities were not satisfactory, so we used audacity (compression, normalization, and noise reduction tools) and Premiere Pro (Lumetri color correction etc.) to 
make the audios and videos much better. The final compilation was also done using Premiere Pro. We added background music, fade in and out effects on audio to shift between
interviews and D2 clips, and video transitions as well.

### Reflection/Evaluation:
    As an initial intention, our group wanted to challenge ourselves and learn how to work with professional equipment, that’s why we used
all the film equipment from the equipment center. However, the quality of the camera turned out to be worse than in simple phones. Moreover, D2 is a loud place so recording
fair quality audio was very difficult. It was still an amazing experience, feeling yourself like in a real film field and being able to work with all the equipment. And despite
the poor qualities of audio and video recordings, we were able to come up with a good final piece by the power of editing.
